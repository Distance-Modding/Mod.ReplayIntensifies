# Distance Replay Intensifies

Distance mod to extend customization for Ghost and Replay Mode cars.

This started off as a port of Reherc's [Replay Limit Breaker](https://github.com/REHERC/Replay-Limit-Breaker) mod for Spectrum mod loader.

## Current Options

* Maximum number of replay cars can be raised up to 1000.
* (Optional) Separate maximum number of replay cars when selecting from the leaderboards menu.
* Maximum number of saved local replays can be raised up to 10000.
* Maximum number of online leaderboard rankings can be raised up to 10000.
* Change the visual style for Ghost and/or Replay Mode cars:
    * **Ghost** - No solid body.
    * **Networked** - Semi solid body that fades away when colliding with the player.
    * **Replay** - Full solid body that doesn't fade away.
    * **Outline**/**no Outline** - Show or hide the car outline color for any of the 3 above styles.
* Change the minimum and maximum car Level of Detail (LOD), to help improve performance or up the graphics.
* Disable clamping opponent car colors, so that ultrabright color presets can be seen (this affects Online mode cars as well).
